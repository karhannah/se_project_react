# Note for the reviewer: A lot of the things weren't fixed because I couldn't replicate them on my machine, on my PC, there is no issue
# with having to refresh, or anything not showing up, or deleted, nor does it crash when I modify the profile, also, apologies for not
# having the link in the readme I had to rewrite at some point from a previous commit and that commit had an old readme.
